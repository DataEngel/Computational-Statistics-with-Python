### 1.- Calculate fibonacci numbers using Memoization Vs Programming normal.  

**What's the memoization?**

In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

### 2.-Random Walk Algorithm. 

**What's Random Walks?**

A random walk is a mathematical object, known as a stochastic or random process, that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space such as the integers.

### 4.-Pi sumulation. 

One method to estimate the value of (3.141592...) is by using a Monte Carlo method. In the demo above, we have a circle of radius 0.5, enclosed by a 1 × 1 square. The area of the circle is π r 2 = π / 4 , the area of the square is 1. If we divide the area of the circle, by the area of the square we get.

### Central Limit Theorem.

The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement , then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.

An example of the Central Limit Theorem with dice:
As is known, the data releases have a uniform distribution, because each number has the same chances of coming out as the other 5 => (1/6). So what I did was create a script where a number of dice rolls are performed and the number of times each number rolled is obtained, then select samples of 10 rolls and find their average.
